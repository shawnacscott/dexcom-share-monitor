I don't know if I'm the right person to do this, but I figured I'd see how far I could get, and whether it was useful!

>While we cannot do anything about Dexcom Share issues, we can help communicate when there is a problem.
>
>To that end, we are offering a $500 bounty for an open source app that checks for Share server availability and then broadcasts that status to a Facebook page and Twitter account on a 15 minute interval.
>
>To qualify for the bounty, the app will:
>Be completely open source;
>Run on our paid Heroku instance;
>Use published APIs for FB and Twitter;
>Not overload Share sign ins.
>
>The developer will work with us to test and have code reviewed by other developers before it is accepted.
>
>We will work with any developer to provide testing information, as well as access to other resources they deem necessary or justifiable.
>
>Rogue Cowboys, do it again!
